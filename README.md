# copedent
Quick script to help me analyze my pedal steel copedent.

## What's a pedal steel?

It's a [stringed instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_steel_guitar) used in all types of music. It's a bit like combining a guitar and a manual transmission car.

## What's a copedent?

*Cho*rd *Ped*al Arrangm*ent*. It's a description for how a pedal steel is tuned and what the pedals and knee levers do.

## Why would you need a Ruby script for this?

Some pedal steels have a few pedals and knee levers, some have a lot - mine has a lot. This tool lets me iterate on the setup quickly in a way that works well for my musical understanding instead of chewing through a lot of paper or Excel spreadsheets. A bit of planning saves a lot of time messing with mechanics.

## Why a script instead of something cleaner/nicer/more complex?

To the above point, I'm building this in an hour or two to free myself up to spend more time on the music. Maybe sometime I'll come back and build this into a web app so it's easier for others to use, too.
